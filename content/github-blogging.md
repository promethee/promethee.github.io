**Willing to give a test to github blogging**

And not really inclined to run anything locally (jekyll, I'm looking at you), I tried something :

Pusblishing articles on gist, and getting them using [gist-embed](https://github.com/blairvanderhoof/gist-embed). 

So far so good, the only thing missing is a "on the fly" gist listing. 

Right now, I must maintain a list of my gist and it's a bit boring, but hey, that's already cool.

Will be working on it.
