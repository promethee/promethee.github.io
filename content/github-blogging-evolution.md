**Dicthing gist-embed**

(yet, it was usefull), for a raw gist api approach.

Having the list of my gist on the fly (because they're public), looping on each one, etc.
Really nice, yet, a lot more to do : 
- styling
- more meta data for each gist,
- link to any given gist (for direct access)

to be continued...
