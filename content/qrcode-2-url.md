**From url to qr code**

Hello,

I've started a small page to convert an url to a qr code ([here](http://promethee.github.io/url2qrcode/?url=http://promethee.github.io/))

**But why ? **

Because sometimes, you may want to open an url without using anything connected to an account.

Transmit an url to your phone, without sync, pushbullet, etc.

Enjoy :)
