**Travis CI**

It's so easy and nice. Right now, I'm testing frontend unit tests with mocha and chai, and will use phantom js ia a few.

Go on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), it's free for open source (public) projects.

You can link you github or bitbucket account, and have nice badges to show off ;)
